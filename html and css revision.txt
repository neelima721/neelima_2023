Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML for short, is a markup language used to outline the DOM (Document Object Model) of a web page.
 Supplemented by Javascript and CSS, they are the languages which can be interpreted by web browsers.
 It is extended from SGML, or after HTML5, XML - which itself is extended from SGML.


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">

    <title>Hello, World!</title>
</head>
<body>

<section>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</section>

</body>
</html>

Constructs¶
HTML has a number of simple constructs, that I will document here, that can be used to produce a simple web page.
 A number of these constructs come inherently from SGML.

Tags¶
SGML is a language built around tags. There are three types of tags - opening, closing, and self-closing tags. Combined opening and closing tags are used to form one node within the DOM, as is a singular self-closing tag.
 Previously (pre-HTML5) self-closing tags were syntactically shown by />, whereas no special syntax is required anymore.

Document Type Declaration¶
The first line of a HTML, or even as SGML or XML, document should be the document type, or DOCTYPE for short, declaration.
 Since HTML5's introduction <!DOCTYPE html> can simply be used as HTML from that point on is parsed as its own language, 
and cannot be parsed by a SGML parser. Prior to HTML5, a dtd file would have to be specified. 
The dtd file is used to describe the constructs that can be used within a SGML file.


Paragraph Text¶
Perhaps the most simple tag in HTML, is the paragraph text tag. Quite simply, they contain paragraph text and thats it.
 I think the best way to demonstrate, is an example: <p>Hello, World!</p>

Header Text¶
There is no better way to structure a document, than by use of headers.
 There are six sizes: 1-6. Again, the best way to demonstrate is by use of an example: <h1>Hi :D</h1>

Hyperlinks¶
Hyperlinks are links which reference another document from within a document.
 For example should I want to make a hyperlink to Donald Trump's Wikipedia page,
 with the text Donald Trump - I would write: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Donald Trump</a>





Web page: is a building block of the websites.
Website: is a collection of web pages.
HTML: Stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, it’s used to describe the structure of web pages.
CSS: Stands for Cascading Style Sheet, CSS defines the display and layout of web pages.
Browsers: are tools used to surve and visit internet web pages, to visit specific website type in the website URL at the address box.
Webservers: are the machines that stores and hosts files and documents of your website.
HTML has three types of Lists:
Unordered lists <ul>: Used to define lists when order does not matter
Ordered Lists <ol>: Used to define lists where sequence and order is the significance.
Definition Lists <dd><dt>: used to describe list of terms and their definitions.
HTML elements mostly come in pairs of tags, Opening tag and Closing tag
<br> element used to introduce new line in HTML document and break the current line.
<hr> element used to insert horizontal rule/line in HTML document.
<p> element defines paragraphs in HTML.
<a> element used to describe hyperlinks/links in HTML, links in HTML can be divided into Relative links and Absolute links.
<img> element inserts images in your HTML document.
<head> element contains title and meta information of the web page.
<body> element contains actual contents that will be shown in the browser window.
<!doctype> is not actually a tag, but a declaration, telling the browser what kind of HTML you are using. Default version is HTML 5.
<b> element makes characters and texts appear bold.
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and were developed in 1994.
CSS Syntax: selector/element {property: value;}
CSS rule has two main parts: a selector, and one or more declarations.
CSS selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
CSS declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
Each CSS declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon.
CSS Selectors are: Type/Element selector, ID selector, Class selector, Group selector
CSS Type/Element: is used to apply the style using tag name. The type selector selects an element by its type, it represents the element or HTML tag to style.
CSS ID Selector: Matches an element whose id attribute has a value that matches the one specified after the pound or hash symbol.
CSS Class Selector: Matches an element whose class attribute has a value that matches the one specified after the period (or full stop) symbol.
CSS Group Selector: Groups multiple selectors in a single style declaration.
There are three ways of inserting a style sheet: In-line styles, internal style sheets (embedded), External style sheets (linked).
In-line style is included with the tag it affects. To create an in-line style, simply add the STYLE attribute right into the attribute list of the tag.
Internal Style Sheets.
Internal style sheets: all instructions are collected and placed at the top of the HTML document. All instructions must be enclosed within the <STYLE> tag.
CSS properties can be categorized into: Font attributes, Color attributes, Links attributes, Background attributes and Margins and Alignment.
Common CSS font-formatting attributes are: font-family, font-style, font-weight, text-align, letter-spacing, text-decoration and text-transform.
Common CSS color Attributes: color, background and border-color.
 


Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.

With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, 
how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used,
 different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!

Using CSS
CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file
The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, 
in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.

Inline CSS
An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.

An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element.

The following example sets the text color of the <h1> element to blue, and the text color of the <p> element to red:

Example
<h1 style="color:blue;">A Blue Heading</h1>

<p style="color:red;">A red paragraph.</p>

Internal CSS
An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.

An internal CSS is defined in the <head> section of an HTML page, within a <style> element.

The following example sets the text color of ALL the <h1> elements (on that page) to blue, and the text color of ALL the <p> elements to red. In addition, the page will be displayed with a "powderblue" background color: 

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {background-color: powderblue;}
h1   {color: blue;}
p    {color: red;}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
External CSS
An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.

To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the <head> section of each HTML page:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
The external style sheet can be written in any text editor. The file must not contain any HTML code, and must be saved with a .css extension.

Here is what the "styles.css" file looks like:

"styles.css":
body {
  background-color: powderblue;
}
h1 {
  color: blue;
}
p {
  color: red;
}
